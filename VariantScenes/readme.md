# 🖼️ Altered Gradients  

### 📂 About This Folder  
This folder contains **image variations** where the background remains the same, but elements or color gradients differ. Examples include:  
- The same scene in **daylight vs. night** 🌞🌙  
- Different **color tints or moods** applied to an image 🎨  
- Objects appearing or disappearing while the backdrop stays unchanged 🚲➡️🚫  

### 🏷️ Naming Convention  
Files in this folder follow the format:  

`whatevername_0X.ext`

where **X** is a number (e.g., `_01, _02, _03`) indicating different versions of the same base image.  

### 💾 Example Filenames  
- **Cityscape_01.jpg** → Daytime version  
- **Cityscape_02.jpg** → Sunset version  
- **ForestPath_01.png** → With a bicycle  
- **ForestPath_02.png** → Without a bicycle  

Keep things **organized & aesthetic!** ✨😺
