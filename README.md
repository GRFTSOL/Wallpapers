There are many more which I do not recollect, some of which no more exist😿 but gave me inspiration to make this collection!

There are tonnes of people who collect Wallpapers, just search for [Wallpapers in Github](https://github.com/topics/wallpapers)💘!

## NOTE

Do not like😟 the resolution, no worries😸!

Use AI Upscalers to Upscale it, if you have any VULCAN supported device do it directly on device with this FOSS software [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/download). 

Trust me! you wont regret it!!!😻

Only general rule of thumb, avoid `webp` as people might have some trouble on Windows settings webp images as wallpaper😿, though workaround exists always, read [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/vjw0ly/add_set_as_desktop_background_context_menu_entry/).
